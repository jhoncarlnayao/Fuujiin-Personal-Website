    <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight">I'm Fuujin</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed text-justify">
        I'm a 4th-year student at the University of Mindanao in Davao City with a strong passion for <span class="font-semibold text-white">web development</span> and digital design. Over the years, I have explored different areas such as <span class="font-semibold text-[#00FFD1]">Figma designs</span>, <span class="font-semibold text-white">pixel art</span>, and <span class="font-semibold text-[#00FFD1]">poster creation</span>. I enjoy taking on personal projects because they allow me to experiment, learn new technologies, and challenge myself creatively.
        <br><br>
        Most of my projects are self-initiated, giving me the freedom to explore new concepts and improve my technical skills. I also take on small commissions, which help me understand client needs and deliver functional, visually appealing results. By combining development and design, I aim to create projects that are both user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
        <br><br>
        Beyond coding and design, I enjoy learning about new tools and trends in the tech industry, constantly pushing myself to grow as a developer and designer. Every project I work on, whether personal or commissioned, is an opportunity to explore ideas, solve problems, and create something meaningful. I believe in learning by doing, and this approach has allowed me to build a versatile skill set that continues to evolve.
